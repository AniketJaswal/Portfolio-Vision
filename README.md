This project involves using the loan application records of a bank for the year 2021 in order to gain information about the following key performance indicators:   
                       <li> Total Loan Applications
                       <li> Total Funded Amount
                       <li> Total Amount Received
                       <li> Average Interest Rate
                       <li> Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

In order to evaluate the performance of the bank, a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria was created which involved the usage of the following KPIs wrt to Good Loans and Bad Loans:

<B>Good Loan KPIs:</B>
<li>Good Loan Application Percentage
<li>Good Loan Applications
<li>Good Loan Funded Amount
<li>Good Loan Total Received Amount

<B>Bad Loan KPIs:</B>
<li>Bad Loan Application Percentage
<li>Bad Loan Applications
<li>Bad Loan Funded Amount
<li>Bad Loan Total Received Amount





<br/><br/> The following steps were followed while developing this project:

<I><B>Data preparation phase</B></I>
<br/>In order to prepare the dataset for use in the project, data exploration was done to find fields of interest and data cleaning was done to ensure that invalid/missing data was corrected so to eradicate the possibility of incorrect insights in the final report. 

<I><B>Working with SQL</B></I>
<br/>The clean data obtained from the data preparation phase was loaded into MS SQL Sever.SQL queries were created and executed for the creation of KPIs and various fields of interest to find patterns and trends in the data.

<I><B>Working with Power BI</B></I>
<br/>In order to represent the data visually , the cleansed data was loaded into Power BI and underwent furthur exploration. DAX measures were used to create new attributes from the existing attributes and then a dashboard was created to generate colourfula appealing visuals for KPIs and other fields of interest such as :         
                      <li> Orders received per day and per month
                      <li> Pizza sales by category and size
                      <li> Sales trends observed from the data
                      <li> Best and worst selling pizzas
                     
In order to make the dashboard interactive and easy to use, filters were added that allow the dashboard to be changed as per various parameters such as pizza category, the range of day in which the pizzas were sold or to check for sales' records for a specific day.

<I><B>Comparison phase</B></I>
<br/>This was the final step of the project where the created dashboard was compared with the outputs received from the SQL queries in order to ensure that the dashboard created provided correct insights .
